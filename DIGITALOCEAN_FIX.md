# DigitalOcean Deployment Fix

## Issue
The frontend was making API calls to `localhost:5001` instead of `https://atsen.app/api` in production.

## Solution Applied
1. ✅ Created `.env.production` with correct API URL
2. ✅ Created `.env.local` to override development settings
3. ✅ Updated Vite config to handle production environment properly
4. ✅ Updated build script to set NODE_ENV=production

## Next Steps for DigitalOcean

### 1. Redeploy Your Application
In your DigitalOcean App Platform dashboard:
- Go to your app settings
- Trigger a new deployment
- Or push these changes to your connected GitHub repository

### 2. Verify Environment Variables
Make sure these environment variables are set in DigitalOcean:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `VITE_API_URL=https://atsen.app/api` (optional, now hardcoded in build)

### 3. Check Build Logs
After deployment, check the build logs to ensure:
- The production environment script runs successfully
- Frontend builds with correct API URL
- No 404 errors in the console

### 4. Test the Fix
1. Visit https://atsen.app/auth/login
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Check the Console tab - should see:
   - `API Base URL: https://atsen.app/api`
   - `Environment: production`
4. Check Network tab - API calls should go to `https://atsen.app/api/*`

## Troubleshooting

If you still see 404 errors:

1. **Check if backend is running:**
   ```
   curl https://atsen.app/api
   ```
   Should return: `{"message":"ATSEN API is running",...}`

2. **Check health endpoint:**
   ```
   curl https://atsen.app/health
   ```

3. **Verify static file serving:**
   Make sure your DigitalOcean app is configured to:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Start command: `npm run start`
   - Serve static files from the backend
