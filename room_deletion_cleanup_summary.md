- ✅ Added comment directing to institution controller
- ❌ Removed: `deleteRoom` from imports in route file

### 🎨 Frontend Changes

- ❌ Removed: Trash2Icon import and toast/api imports
- ❌ Removed: setRooms prop requirement

## Current State

### ✅ Institution-Only Deletion

- **Route**: `DELETE /api/institutions/:idOrName/rooms/:roomId`
- **Controller**: `backend/src/controllers/institution/CreateRoomController.js`
- **Features**: Full cascading deletes, ownership validation, detailed logging

### ✅ Teacher Interface - Read-Only Room Management

- **Dashboard**: Teachers see their assigned rooms (no delete buttons)
- **Room Settings**: Teachers can edit room details but cannot delete
- **Clear UX**: Users understand rooms are managed by institutions

### ✅ Data Integrity

- **No unauthorized deletions**: Teachers cannot delete rooms
- **Proper cascading**: Institution deletions clean up all related data
- **Audit trail**: Institution-level accountability for deletions

## Benefits

### 🔒 **Security Improvements**

- Prevents accidental room deletion by teachers
- Ensures proper authorization hierarchy
- Institution maintains control over room lifecycle

### 🎯 **User Experience**

- Clear indication of who manages what
- No confusing delete buttons for teachers
- Consistent with institutional authority model

### 🧹 **Code Cleanliness**

- Removed duplicate/unused deletion logic
- Single source of truth for room deletion
- Simplified teacher interface components

### 📊 **Business Logic Alignment**

- Rooms are institutional assets
- Institution controls room lifecycle
- Teachers focus on content, not infrastructure

## Verification Steps

To verify the cleanup:

1. ✅ **Backend**: Try accessing `DELETE /api/rooms/:id` - should return 404
2. ✅ **Frontend**: Teacher dashboard shows rooms without delete buttons
3. ✅ **Frontend**: Room settings page has no delete button
4. ✅ **Institution**: Institution interface still has working delete functionality
5. ✅ **Cascading**: Institution deletions properly clean up all related data

## Next Steps (Optional)

Consider these future improvements:

1. **Remove old room creation from teachers** if institutions should handle all room management
2. **Add room transfer functionality** for moving rooms between institutions
3. **Implement room archiving** as an alternative to deletion
4. **Add bulk room operations** for institutions managing many rooms

The cleanup is now complete! Room deletion is exclusively handled by institutions with proper cascading deletes and data integrity.
